Hello, this is the first line.
This is the second line, which is longer than the first line.
Third line! This one has punctuation marks: .,!? and symbols: #@*&.

This is an empty line above, with just a newline.
Here is a line with special characters: äöüßçñ.
This line is extremely long and does not contain any newline characters, which will be interesting for buffer handling because get_next_line() will need to accumulate this line across multiple reads until it reaches the end of the file. We are testing how it handles very long lines efficiently without missing any data.

Short line.
Another one.
Another empty line above!

This is a final line that does not end with a newline
